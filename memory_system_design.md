# Enhanced Memory System Design

## Core Components

### 1. Conversation Summarization
- Periodic summarization of conversation chunks
- Key topic extraction and relationship mapping
- Important decision/conclusion tracking

### 2. Knowledge Graph
- Topic nodes and relationships
- Code components and their purposes
- Decision history and rationale

### 3. Context Retrieval
- Semantic search over conversation history
- Relevant context injection for new topics
- Smart context window management

## Implementation Steps
1. Add conversation chunking and summarization
2. Implement topic extraction and knowledge graph
3. Create context retrieval system
4. Integrate with existing conversation manager

## Files to Create/Modify
- memory_manager.py (new)
- knowledge_graph.py (new) 
- Update claude_conversation_manager.py
- Add memory configuration options


# Memory Manager Implementation

## ConversationSummarizer Class
- Chunks conversations into logical segments
- Extracts key topics, decisions, and code changes
- Maintains running summary with importance weighting

## KnowledgeGraph Class  
- Stores topics, relationships, and context
- Tracks code components and their evolution
- Links conversations to specific improvements

## ContextRetriever Class
- Semantic similarity search over summaries
- Smart context injection based on current topic
- Manages context window to prevent overflow

## Integration Points
- Hook into claude_conversation_manager.py after each message
- Periodic summarization (every N messages)
- Context retrieval before generating responses
- Persistent storage in JSON/SQLite
