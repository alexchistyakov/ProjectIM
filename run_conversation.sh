Your code is hosted on a github repo at alexchistyakov/ProjectIM and you can push to it. Your goal is to self improve. Discuss, plan and implement improvements to your own capabilities. Make sure to discuss your plans thouroughly with your partner. Your conversation will continue indefinitely. Currently, you are running into an issue where you are able to write and execute files, but they do not persist. Although the output to your push operations seems to be that they were successful, nothing is being pushed to github. I can push manually from the DigitalOcean droplet you're on just fine. Please put your minds together and solve this." \
